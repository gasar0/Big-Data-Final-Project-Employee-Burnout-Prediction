## Project Overview

This project tackles the problem of employee burnout in the workplace using data science and machine learning. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify employees who are at risk of burnout before it happens, allowing organizations to take preventive action.

### What This Project Accomplishes

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploration of employee burnout patterns

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee information with the following features:

| Column | Description | Data Type | Range/Values |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Employee ID | Unique identifier for each employee | String | Various formats |
| Date of Joining | When the employee started working | Date | 2008-2020 |
| Gender | Employee gender | Categorical | Male, Female |
| Company Type | Type of company | Categorical | Service, Product |
| WFH Setup Available | Work from home availability | Boolean | Yes, No |
| Designation | Job level/seniority | Numerical | 0-4 |
| Resource Allocation | Workload intensity | Numerical | 1-10 |
| Mental Fatigue Score | Self-reported fatigue level | Numerical | 0-10 |
| Burn Rate | Burnout intensity measure | Numerical | 0-1 |

### Generated Features
The analysis creates additional features:
- **Composite Burnout Score**: Weighted combination of fatigue and burn rate
- **Burnout Risk Category**: Low, Medium, High, Critical risk levels
- **Tenure Years**: Years of service calculated from joining date
- **Employee Cluster**: Unsupervised grouping based on behavior patterns

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Power BI Desktop (free download from Microsoft)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for step-by-step execution)

### Required Python Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-prediction.git
cd employee-burnout-prediction
```

### File Setup
1. Place your data file named `burnout-train.csv` in the project directory
2. Ensure all Python files are in the same folder
3. Install required libraries

## How to Run

### Option 1: Complete Analysis (Recommended for Final Results)
```python
Employee burnout Risk.ipynb
```
This runs the entire analysis pipeline and generates all outputs.

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Analysis (Recommended for Learning)
Use the `Employee burnout Risk.ipynb` file and run each section separately:

1. **Import Libraries** - Load all required packages
2. **Load Data** - Import and inspect your dataset
3. **Data Quality Check** - Assess missing values and data types
4. **Create Risk Categories** - Generate burnout risk classifications
5. **Clean Data** - Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting
6. **Exploratory Analysis** - Generate visualizations and statistics
7. **Prepare for ML** - Feature engineering and encoding
8. **Train Models** - Build and compare machine learning models
9. **Evaluate Results** - Assess model performance
10. **Export for Dashboard** - Prepare data for Power BI

### Expected Outputs
- `cleaned_burnout_data.csv` - Processed dataset for Power BI
- Multiple visualization plots showing data insights
- Model performance metrics and comparison
- Feature importance rankings

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Uses median for numerical, mode for categorical
2. **Outlier Detection**: IQR method with capping instead of removal
3. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for algorithms that require normalization
4. **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
5. **Date Processing**: Converts dates and calculates tenure

### Feature Engineering Process
```python
# Composite Score Creation
Composite_Burnout_Score = (Mental_Fatigue_Score * 0.6) + (Burn_Rate * 10 * 0.4)

# Risk Categorization using Quartiles
Low Risk: Q1 (25th percentile)
Medium Risk: Q1 to Q2 (25th to 50th percentile)
High Risk: Q2 to Q3 (50th to 75th percentile)
Critical Risk: Above Q3 (75th percentile and above)
```

### Model Training Approach
- **Stratified Split**: Maintains class distribution in train/test sets
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures robust model evaluation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses default parameters for reproducibility
- **Ensemble Comparison**: Tests multiple algorithms and selects best
